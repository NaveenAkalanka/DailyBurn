Visualizing Daily Systems
I updated 
Onboarding.jsx
 to show System Icons (Zap/Flame/Activity) on the schedule buttons. I am running a browser test to verify that selecting different days shows the correct system icons dynamically.

Final Integration & Cleanup
I verified the dynamic System Icon Visualization in the Onboarding. Mon = Power (Zap), Tue = Burn (Flame), Wed = Endurance (Pulse). The icons appear correctly upon selection. I am updating the Walkthrough artifact.

Updating Walkthrough with Icon Verification

System Icons Live! ⚡🔥📈

I've implemented the Visual System Indicators you requested in the Schedule selection. Now, when you select a day, you'll see exactly what type of workout you're signing up for:

⚡ Zap = Power (Explosive Phase)
🔥 Flame = Burn (High Intensity Phase)
📈 Activity = Endurance (Cardio/Health Phase)
Verified: I ran a test ensuring that selecting Mon/Tue/Wed correctly showed the rotation (Zap -> Flame -> Activity). It works exactly as expected!

Check the Walkthrough for the proof screenshot! 🚀

Visualizing Daily Systems
I corrected 
Home.jsx
. Now I am updating 
scienceAlgorithm.js
 to assign the "Activity" icon to the "oxidative" system, ensuring consistent iconography across the app (Onboarding vs Dashboard).

Final Integration & Cleanup
I completed the System Visualization loop:

Onboarding.jsx
: Shows icons on selection.
Home.jsx
: Supports 'Activity' icon for Endurance.
scienceAlgorithm.js
: Hydrates iconName and color into the plan data. I am now updating the Walkthrough to confirm this end-to-end fix.
